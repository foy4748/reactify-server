# #07 State & Lifecycle

## Documentations

State and Lifecycle [↗](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)

# Component Types

Class components are by default “Stateful” component and Functional components are by default “Stateless” components.  Then what is State in React? 

# State

State is simply a set of data which may vary/change based on user interaction or so. Props is also some sort of state, but props are used to pass down state from a parent component to its children component if necessary. 

State is a self contained data-set/ set of variables inside a component. A single component may have the functionality of entire application, hence its own state. **A component re-renders if the state or props of it’s react element changes. Props are usually a way of communication between a Parent-Child components as  components can be nested.** 

# Handle State

React elements can’t be changed after construction, but we can change the states of the component and based on the state change, the element is re-rendered/re-created again.  This change of state can be done only by the methods provided by `React.Component` that we extend inside our component. 

The state should be handled in *React’s Way* otherwise unpredictable things will happen. 

First we need to define the `constructor` function which constructs the parent class —> `React.Component`   ‘s props. Then inside the `constructor`, we can define the state variables only as a property of `this.state` objects property. `this.state` is inherited from the `React.Component` as we’ve extended it. 

If we want to change the state, then we should use the `setState` method provided in `this` keyword. The code example below will put the handling state concept in  place.

*./component/MyComponent.js*

```jsx
//import React from 'react';

//Or you can directly
//destructure 'Component'
//from 'react'
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class MyComponent extends Component{
	constructor(props){
		//Calling the Parent's constructor
		//via super(props)
		super(props);

		//Defining a state variable
		this.state = {myState: 'Writing these Notes'}
	}

	handleClick = (e) => {
		
		//Changing state using setState function
		//If the paragraph element is clicked
		this.setState({myState:"Browsing the web"});
	}

	//This render() method is mandatory
	render(){
		const { myState } = this.state;
		return(
			<p onClick={() => this.handleClick()} >
				I'm {myState} 
			</p>
		);
}

export default MyComponent;
```

# Lifecyle Methods

Class based components have Lifecyle methods inherited from `React.Component` . These methods decides what to do when a component is rendering on screen, how a component should behave when a state or prop change, and destroy/non-function a component if someone hits another route or want to see other things on screen. 

`componentDidMount` , `componentShouldUpdate`  ,`componentWillUnmount` etc. are some common lifecycle methods of Class based component.  They are self explanatory according to their names.
