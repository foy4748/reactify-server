# #08 Handling Events & Controlling Re-Render

Typically in HTML/Plain JavaScript, the onclick, onfocus etc event attribute takes a functionâ€™s reference which is a string refers to the functionâ€™s name. We donâ€™t execute the function as we pass it as attribute value.

In React, the event attributes must in in camelCase, since the components are created using JSX. Then, itâ€™s similar to Plain HTML/JS. It requires a function reference inside those curly braces { }, which is the variable that stores the method, usually `this.theMethod`. Donâ€™t execute/call the function while passing it to the event attributes inside JSX. Remember the difference between **Passing Reference** Vs **Executing Function() .**

React Event handing methods can access the event object in the first parameter just like typical event handling function. Useful to prevent default, capturing event or so.

Suppose, weâ€™ve implemented the example shown in the video. Now changing the componentâ€™s state variable (say count or so) by clicking a button. Hence, listening to a click event using a React Component method to change componentâ€™s state

When the event handling method try to execute `this.setState( )`, it throws an error!! Because, Event Handling React Class Component Method is running in the **Browserâ€™s DOM context**. It doesnâ€™t have `this` inside the React Class Componentâ€™s  context.  The event handler must be executed in Browserâ€™s context, not in Virtual DOMâ€™s context, because the event will occur at the DOM that browser is currently rendering. 

Since the event handling method is called as a event handling callback function while rendering Browser/Real DOM, it requires to introduce the React Class Componentâ€™s `this` keyword to to the event handling callback function / method. This can be done in three ways.

# 1. Using Function.prototype.bind() method

As we know, the bind() method takes an object as first parameter. The object that bind() method operates on/calls upon, make the  parameter objectâ€™s methods available to that object. And, it returns the method to call that method whenever convenient. You can pass the parameters for the function returned by bind() using  comma separated values, after the object is passed as first 
argument.  Or the returned function can be called by passing those arguments. 

You can read the MDN doc here. [Function.prototype.bind() - JavaScript | MDN (mozilla.org)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind)
[Remember: bind() always returns a new instance of the method]

``So, we can do `this.theEventHandlingMethod = this.theEventHandlingMethod.bind(this)` in the `constructor()` function of the Class component. 

# 2. Using Arrow function â‡’

Since Arrow function doesnâ€™t have itâ€™s own `this` keyword. It simply runs in Browserâ€™s Window context. `this` inside the arrow function, simply refers to the `window` object of the currently rendering DOM. (! May be wrong, research more) Thatâ€™s why event handling function written using arrow function works like a charm in React. 

# Performance / Re-render Control

*Timestamp #Video 08 [37:37] Performance / Re-render Control*

Functions / Methods can also be passed down to child components via props since Functions are simply First-Class objects in JS realm. 

*[ JSX should use `this` in props / .bind( ) ]*

To control Re-rendering, `shouldComponentUpdate` life-cycle method is used inside Class Component.

*[ It requires precise implementation since wrong logic will prevent further re-rendering of child element. Specially keep in mind the **pass by reference** issue in JavaScript ]*

`shouldComponentMount` should return `true` or `false` at the end. If `false` is returned, it wonâ€™t re-render the component. Since the video is using `bind( )`method to pass the function reference to the Button component, itâ€™s not working because `bind( )` constructs new instance of the function. Even though, the props / arguments are not changing, but each instance of the function is a new reference. Thatâ€™s why equality checking ( === ) is returning `false` since their references are different. *[ This is why ESLint doesnâ€™t recommend using `bind( )` in JSX ]*

# Best Practices

1. Use Arrow function â‡’ for event handling methods.
2. Donâ€™t send parameters along with functions reference, send those parameters via props.
3. Donâ€™t use `shouldComponentUpdate` frequently. ðŸ˜… Logically preventing unnecessary re-render of a large component is convenient. Re-rendering small components is not an issue. 

React solves development issues at some costs of performance. But itâ€™s worth it. Building a large scale application requires a clean way of development. Performance can be optimized later. Obsession with performance for trimming few milliseconds is obsolete.
