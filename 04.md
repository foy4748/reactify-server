# #06 Components and Props

## Documentations

Components and Props [â†—](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)

# Component Concept

React element is the core building block of React app.

Browser parses HTML from server, and then typical Node/DOM tree. This 'browser made DOM Tree' is not valid JS object. It's something that browser understands. But React creates elements in plain JS object for its Virtual DOM.

Since React element is immutable, it's pretty dumb. Once a React element created can't be changed. But React Component helps to change the React elements before they are created. Hence, React Component cant return React Elements based on the state/props provided.

# Component Conventions

React components are either typical JS function or Class which returns/create React element. Those functions/classes can be called such as **`<MyComponent />`** . Different from calling a typical JS function or creating object instance using classes. But this **`<MyComponent />`** syntax allows to pass attributes just like HTML which is knows as props/state in React. **Make sure you name the Component Function/Class in Pascal case i.e MyComponent**.

*App.js*

```jsx
import React from "react";
//import logo from "./logo.svg";
import "./App.css";

//Importing our Component first
import MyComponent from './component/MyComponent';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
		      <MyComponent />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

While passing attributes in <ComponentName/> such as 

`<MyComponent studentName={"Faisal Rahman"} />`

then the component can access those attribute value inside it's argument as a valid JS object. It's a good practice to destructure necessary propertis from the attribute/props object.

*./component/MyComponent.js*

```jsx
import React from 'react';

class MyComponent extends React.Component {

	//This render() method is mandatory
	render() {

		//Destructuring studentName from 
		//Props that was sent from the App.js
		const {studentName} = this.props; 
		
		return(
			<p> Student's Name: {studentName} </p>
		);
	}
}

export default MyComponent;
			
```

To have the super powers of React, hence, inherite React's built-in methods, it requires to extend React.Component while creating a Class based component. The props and states can be accessed inside the Class as this.state or this.props  respectively. **A class component should have a method named *render* which is provided by React.Component**. This render method is called by default for rendering the elements for first time or re-render the element if any state or prop changes.

# State and Props Concept

Class based components can listen to state change directly (doesn't require any extra help/function to listen to state/prop change). Since class is a blueprint of creating object, in this case, React Element, it can take necessary arguments as state/props, then creates React Elements.

# Scope of State

A component can maintain it's own states. As many as possible React Elements can be created using a React Component, and each instance of React Element will maintain its own state!!!. That's a beauty of React!
