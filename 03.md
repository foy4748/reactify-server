Rendering Elements [↗](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html)

# The way Browser renders HTML

Remember how vanilla JS manipulate DOM ? It creates new elements by **document.createElement("div")** ,  then puts contents inside as necessary. Then it would update the browser DOM by appending the newly created NodeType element.

Vanilla JS directly manipulates the DOM, and it's capable of creating DOM Nodes/Elements.

# The way React renders

On the other hand, REACT doesn't manipulate the Browser DOM directly. It compares the Replicated/Virtual DOM with the Browser DOM currently rendered, compares the state of these DOMs. If state/property changes, then React creates Necessary DOM Nodes/ React elements and replace the corresponding. First, React updates theVirtual DOM by calculating all possible state or property change altogether (**batch update**). Then renders theVirtual DOM as actual Browser DOM.

Unlike Browser DOM Nodes/Elements, React Nodes or Elements are simple JS object which specifies how BrowserDOM will look llike after rendering. Creating Reat elements by using React.createElement() function is a big hassle. That's why **Babel** transpiler comes into play.

# Babel

**Babel** takes HTML/XML look-a-like syntax and converts them in React Elements which are just JS objects. Then ReactDOM constructs Browser DOM based on the JS object produced by transpiling those HTMLish syntax.

Babel(HTMLish Syntax) ---> Plain JS Object ---> ReactElement(Plain JS Object) ---> ReactDOM/Virtual DOM

> Don't use " " to wrap around JSX. Use (  ) instead. Since JSX are not plain text

Just like HTML element has attributes, React Elements also have attributes. Those can be accessed by the "key" props. React element is the smallest building block of React.

# React & ReactDOM

React library only creates React Node/Element for the Virtual DOM tree.
ReactDOM library renders the Virtual DOM to the Main Browser DOM.

# Immutable React Element

A React Node/Element is IMMUTABLE. That means, React Node/Element can't be changed after constructing.If you need to change anything in React Node/Element, you need to do it before rendering or so. Reactre-calculates the React element if data/state/prop changes. It simply deletes the previous element and creates a new element if data/state/prop changes.
