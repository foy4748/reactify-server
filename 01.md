# What is React? How does it work?

## Why React?

According to the official doc, “React” is a JS Library for building user interfaces (front-end). It handles user interactions on the web just like other front-end technologies but what makes it unique???

Suppose we want to build a counter interface using typical HTML, CSS & a bit of JS. Grabbing HTML elements for counter placeholder, updating counter value, injecting incremented value in the placeholder — pretty straightforward , right??

What happens when you want to build two counters at the same page?

It will require grabbing those HTML elements using unique selectors such as class/ids !!

If it’s a website like facebook and there are tons of counters such as Reaction Counters (Like, Love, Haha, Care, Angry etc), it would be a nightmare to select those elements using JS DOM operation and updating their states.

### *React solves this problem mentioned above.*

## Most fundamental operations by “React”

Let’s include “React” into our html document by reading [official doc](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#add-react-in-one-minute). Then keep a div with id=”root”. This is the container of the “React Elements” to be rendered. Instead of document.createElement(), we will be using React.createElement() to create HTML elements in the “React” world.

Using theReact library, React creates its own (Virtual!) DOM elements. Then ReactDOM library renders /pushes those created (Virtual) DOM elements to the Real Browser DOM tree. Soon we will discuss React's Virtual DOM.

We can create elements by React’s trivial way of creating element by the React.createElement() function. But it’s quite a hassle. So, it’s convenient to use  JSX syntax to React element which is very similar to HTML, but has the super powers of JavaScript.

JSX stands for Extensible JavaScript which is a combo of XML and JavaScript.

## Summary

React says,

*“If you manage states in React’s way, you don’t need to worry about DOM.”*

If react’s way is used to maintain states,then the elements made by React can be reused multiple times with their individual states maintained! Now think of that facebook example.

*Never touch DOM while working with React.*
